 Vulnerability Management
==========================

OpenStack projects take security vulnerability reports seriously and
handle them with care. The use cases for OpenStack software vary,
but include high-profile services and exposed systems which could
easily put sensitive data or other resources at risk of compromise
if left vulnerable to exploitation.

Vulnerability Management Team
=============================

OpenStack has a `vulnerability management team`_ (VMT) which serves
a number of purposes within the project. The OpenStack VMT provides
direct vulnerability management for a `security-supported subset`_
of OpenStack software meeting established criteria, but more
importantly maintains recommended `processes`_, `templates`_, a
`report taxonomy`_ and similar tools which can be applied by any
project team to ease the burden of managing their own vulnerability
reports and publish corresponding advisories.

Embargoed Vulnerability Management
==================================

The vast majority of security vulnerability reports for OpenStack
software begin as ``private security`` bugs at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ visible only to the OpenStack
`vulnerability management team`_ and the initial reporter. If the
bug is of sufficient severity (determined subjectively based on a
number of context-specific factors), effort will be taken to keep it
temporarily private while it is researched and necessary fixes are
discussed, developed and reviewed. This temporary secrecy is
referred to as an *embargo* and serves to allow time to prepare a
solution and communicate it to a vetted group of stakeholders such
as software distributions, deployers and service providers who may
need extra time to have these fixes in place before the
vulnerability becomes known to the general public.

During the embargo period, subject matter experts such as liaisons_,
project-specific core security review teams and the `core Security
Team reviewers`_ may be subscribed to the bug to provide insight and
assist in bringing it to conclusion. Once a fix has been drafted and
downstream stakeholders have been warned, patches are pushed into
the normal public code review system and a `security advisory`_
(OSSA) is sent to OpenStack and general free/open software mailing
lists.

Public Vulnerability Reports
============================

Many OpenStack security vulnerabilities start out within public
view either as bugs and patches which are later discovered to imply
some exploitable condition, or reports which the reporter or subject
matter experts deem of minimal criticality, or issues which are
simply not easily resolved in private due to the amount of
additional community involvement required to thoroughly mitigate the
associated risk. There are a variety of circumstances under which
the additional resource and efficiency costs of embargoed
vulnerability management simply outweigh the benefit of a brief
window of secrecy, but which still ultimately end in a security
advisory.

Security Contacts
=================

If a bug reporter chooses not to file a bug report on their own but
still wishes to report a vulnerability in private, they can send
encrypted E-mail to one or more of the VMT members' OpenPGP keys_ to
have a ``private security`` bug opened on their behalf.

Security Enhancements
=====================

It's not at all uncommon, after review of the circumstances
presented in a suspected vulnerability report, to deem it
unnecessary to issue an associated security advisory. Factors which
weigh on this decision include whether the bug is actually
exploitable, whether it's a common/known condition pervading much of
OpenStack software, whether the fix can be safely backported to
stable branches without introducing potentially disruptive behavior
changes, whether it depends on configurations already documented as
insecure, whether it requires the existence of another more
significant vulnerability to leverage successfully, and whether it's
a vulnerability of some other dependency rather than within
OpenStack software itself.

These can still represent bugs which need to be fixed, and perhaps
which increase the overall defense-in-depth security of the
software... so-called *security hardening* opportunities. In many of
these cases non-advisory recommendations may still be published in
the form of `security notes`_ (OSSN), addenda to the `OpenStack
Security Guide`_. Also new and existing projects can benefit from a
variety of proactive resources provided by the `OpenStack Security
Team`_ such as the `secure development guidelines`_ and the Bandit_
source code security analyzer.
