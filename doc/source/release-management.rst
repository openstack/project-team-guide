====================
 Release Management
====================

OpenStack project teams produce a large variety of code repositories. Some
are services providing infrastructure APIs. Some are libraries being consumed
by those services. Some are supporting cast and tools. Most of those
are formally "released" at given points. We call those "deliverables", and
use git tags to define the release points. Deliverables may contain multiple
git repositories, which are all tagged with the same version at the same
moment.

OpenStack deliverables can be released under four different models. Most
follow a common 6-month development cycle, with some releasing intermediary
releases within that. The release management team manages the release process
for all deliverables following the development cycle, and provide tools for
cycle-independent deliverables and other teams and repositories to do
self-service releases.


Release models
==============

Common cycle with development milestones
----------------------------------------

By default, most OpenStack services opt to follow a common, time-based
release model. It results in a single release at the end of the development
cycle, with a few milestones to mark the progress in between. It is
recommended at the middle stages of development, when regular releases
are desirable, but release management is not internalized in the team,
and testing coverage is not perfect yet.

Projects following that model use a pre-version numbering scheme. If the
final release will be called 5.0.0, intermediary milestones will be called
5.0.0.0b1, 5.0.0.0rc2 etc.

This time-based release model includes 3 development milestones, called
``$SERIES-1``, ``$SERIES-2`` and ``$SERIES-3``. Those make useful reference
points in time to organize the development cycle. Project teams may, for
example, set specific deadlines that match those dates. b1, b2 and b3 tags are
pushed to the repositories to clearly mark those reference points in the git
history.

The dates for the milestones and final release in a given development cycle
are defined by the Release Management team, and communicated before the new
development cycle starts on `http://releases.openstack.org`.

The $series-3 milestone coincides with Feature Freeze ("FF"). Managed projects
are requested to stop merging code adding new features, new dependencies, new
configuration options, database schema changes, changes in strings... all
things that make the work of packagers, documenters or testers more difficult.
Feature Freeze Exceptions ("FFE") may be exceptionally granted by project PTLs
(or release liaison), but every FFE accepted results in more work, less time
spent testing and fixing issues in release candidates, therefore lowering the
quality of the end release. The closer we get to the final release date, the
greater the impact on release quality. In doubt, the Release Team is available
for advice.

At the same time as Feature Freeze, is Soft String Freeze. Translators start
to translate the strings after ``$SERIES-3``. To aid their work, it is
important to avoid changing existing strings, as this will invalidate some of
their translation work. New strings are allowed for things like new log
messages, as in many cases leaving those strings untranslated is better than
not having any message at all.

After the $series-3 milestone, each team works on a list of release-critical
bugs, and when they consider that all the critical issues are fixed (or
considered not-release-critical after all), the release liaison requests the
publication of a first release candidate (rc1). This RC1 will be used as-is
as the final release, unless new release-critical issues are found that
warrant a RC respin.

After RC1 is tagged, a stable/$series branch is cut from that same commit.
That is where further release candidates (and the final release) will be
tagged. The master branch starts on the new development cycle and is no
longer feature-frozen.

After RC1 is tagged, that project hits a Hard String Freeze. At this point the
translation team tries to complete the translation before the final release.
Any string changes after RC1 should be discussed with the translation
team. It is expected that at least 10 working days after RC1 there will be
another milestone tagged that includes the latest translations.

Potential new release critical issues have first to get fixed on the master
branch. Once merged in master, they can be backported to the release branch.
The PROJECTNAME-stable-maint team is tasked with approving such backports.
Once all the desired backports (and translations updates) are merged, a new
release candidate can be produced.

On final release day, the Release Team will take each project's last release
candidate and re-tag it with the final release version. There is no difference
between the last release candidate and the final version, apart from the
version number. The stable branch then passes under stable maintenance team
management, and is open for backports following the stable branch rules.

Common cycle with intermediary releases
---------------------------------------

Projects which want to do a formal release more often, but still want to
coordinate a release at the end of the cycle from which to maintain a stable
branch may opt for this model. All our libraries follow this model, in order
to allow for immediate consumption of new features in consuming projects.
But this is also potentially suitable for regular projects, either at the
very early stages (where releasing often can be useful) or once the project
is more stable, changes are limited, automated testing can be relied on, and
the team decided to more directly handle release management.

Projects following this model do not use intermediary development milestones.
They may request publication of versions at any point in time during the
development cycle. They do not use Feature Freeze, they do not go through a
release candidate cycle. Every tag is a release that should be be consumable by
users. They use a post-version semver-based numbering scheme, where every tag
is a X.Y.Z version.

Those projects must request a final version for a development cycle (generally
in the last month of the cycle). A stable branch is cut from that proposed
version, and the master branch will from then on produce releases of the
next development cycle. If a critical issue is found in the "final release",
backports can be pushed to the stable branch and a new release be requested
there. That is why it is important to increment at least the Y component
of the X.Y.Z version when we switch to the next development cycle, so that the
Z component can be used in future tags on the release (or stable) branch.

While the release management team will not enforce a formal feature-frozen
period for projects in an intermediary release model, it is recommended to
focus on bug fixes and hold on major disruptive features as you get closer
to the end of a development cycle, to ensure that the final release of any
given development cycle is as usable and bug-free as it can be.

Trailing the common cycle
-------------------------

Deployment and lifecycle-management tools generally want to follow the
release cycle, but because they rely on the other projects being completed,
they may not always publish their final release at the same time as those
projects. To that effect, they may choose the cycle-trailing release model.

Cycle-trailing projects are given an extra 3 months after the final release
date to request publication of their release. They may otherwise use
intermediary releases or development milestones.

Independent release model
-------------------------

Deliverables that are not part of the main "OpenStack" product release, do
not benefit from a coordinated release or from stable branches may opt to
follow a completely independent release model.

Releases are made from the master branch without any specific constraint,
although the usage of a post-version numbering scheme based on
`semantic versioning`_ is strongly recommended.

.. note::

   Client libraries and libraries distributed by official project
   teams should not use this model.

   In order to support security and critical bug fixes in official
   projects, they all need to provide series-based stable branches. If
   a library has no stable branch for a series, then in order to fix
   issues in the library for that series we must allow new versions
   from the master branch to be used in the stable branch. Sometimes
   that works fine, but in cases where the new release from master
   requires new minimum versions of second-tier dependencies, we
   cannot safely introduce the new version into the stable branch. It
   is better to use the cycle-with-intermediary model, even if a
   project does not aggressively backport changes to the stable
   branches created.

How to release ?
================

Releases occur as often as weekly (or more), and are typically
scheduled for early in the day and early in the week, based on the
time zone of the library maintainers. This scheduling gives the
maintainers plenty of time to handle issues that arise after a new
release is made to minimize the duration of any outage, without
requiring extra effort outside of a normal work week by overlapping
with the weekend.

Technically, releases are created by pushing a *signed* tag to the git
repositories associated with that deliverable. The CI system recognizes the
new signed tag, and triggers the jobs that build the packages, upload them
to the distribution servers (our tarball site and the Python Package Index),
and send email announcements.

For more details about setting up a repository to support automated
releases, see the `Project Creator's Guide`_ from the
*Infrastructure User Manual*.

.. _Project Creator's Guide: https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/creators.html


The tagging and releasing process is error-prone. In order to properly review
proposed tags and run tests before the tag is actually pushed, we use a
specific repository, ``openstack/releases``, to file release requests.
Releases are requested by the PTL or release liaison for the project, in the
form of a patch to the appropriate "deliverables" file of that repository.
See the `README file in that repository`_ for more details.

Such requests are then automatically tested, reviewed and processed by the
Release Team, generally avoiding Mondays and Fridays and periods where the
CI system is not fully operational.

.. _README file in that repository: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/releases/tree/README.rst

.. _semantic versioning: https://docs.openstack.org/pbr/latest/user/semver.html#semantic-versioning-specification-semver

Release Liaisons
================

As with other cross-project teams, the release management team relies
on a liaison from each participating project to help with coordination
and release-related tasks. The liaison is usually the PTL, but the PTL
can also delegate the responsibilities to someone else on the team by
updating the liaison list on the CrossProjectLiaisons_ wiki page.

.. _CrossProjectLiaisons: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons

Liaison Responsibilities
------------------------

The liaison does not have to personally do all of these things, but
must ensure they are done by someone on the project team.

#. Monitor the release schedule and remind team members of deadlines.

#. Ensure that release-related patches in the project are reviewed in
   a timely manner.

   From time to time, teams need to merge changes to their projects to
   stay current with release team practices. The release team relies
   on liaisons to help make and review such changes quickly to avoid
   blocking future releases. For example, keeping the requirements
   lists up to date, adding tools, and updating packaging files.

#. Submit milestone and release tag requests. If the request is not
   submitted by the liaison or PTL, one of them must indicate their
   approval.

#. Coordinate feature freeze exceptions (FFEs) at the end of a release
   cycle (for cycle-with-milestones deliverables), and track blocking
   bug fixes and feature work that must be completed before a release.

   The period between feature freeze and release should be used to
   stabilize new features and fix bugs. However, for every release
   there are a few "must have" features that do not quite make the
   deadline for a variety of reasons. It is up to the project team to
   decide which features they will allow after the deadline, and which
   will be delayed until the next release. The liaison is responsible
   for tracking any open exceptions to the feature freeze, and helping
   the project team to focus their energy on completing the work in a
   timely fashion.

#. Be available in the ``#openstack-release`` IRC channel on freenode
   to answer questions and address issues.

   There are too many projects for the release team to join all of
   their channels. Please join the central release channel when you
   are on IRC.

#. Monitor and participate in mailing list discussions about release
   topics.

   The primary means of communication between the release management
   team and other project teams is the openstack-dev mailing
   list. Liaisons must be subscribed and ensure that they pay
   attention to threads with the topic "[release]". Watch for
   instructions related to deadlines, release changes that need to be
   made, etc.

#. Keep the list of project deliverables (and associated git repositories)
   in the project team reference list in the ``openstack/governance``
   repository (``reference/projects.yaml``) up to date.


Typical Development Cycle Schedule
==================================

The development cycles for cycle-with-milestones deliverables follow a
repeating pattern, which is described in general terms here. The length
of time between milestones may change from cycle to cycle because of
holidays, event scheduling, and other factors, so consult the actual
'Under development' schedule on the `releases website`_ for the actual
schedule.

Weeks with negative numbers are counting down leading to the event
("Release -2" is 2 weeks before the release). Weeks with positive
numbers are counting up following an event ("Feature Freeze +1" is the
week following the feature freeze).

.. note::

  Dates for elections are specified in the Technical Committee charter
  relative to events dates, while most other dates are based on
  community consensus and expressed in terms of the release date.
  Because the events may move around in the cycle, the two scheduling
  systems may overlap differently in different cycles.

Weeks Leading to Milestone 1
----------------------------

*Usually 4-6 weeks*

- Finishing work left over from previous cycle
- Completing blueprint and spec discussions
- Foundational work for the rest of the cycle

Weeks Leading to Milestone 2
----------------------------

*Usually 5-6 weeks*

Normal development work

Weeks Leading to Milestone 3
----------------------------

*Usually 4-6 weeks*

- Feature development completion
- Bug fixes
- Stabilization work

Feature Freeze -1
-----------------

The week before the full feature freeze we prepare the final releases
for Oslo and other non-client libraries to give consuming projects
time to stabilize and for the owners to prepare bug fixes if needed.

- Final Oslo and non-client library release

.. note::

  Exceptions may be requested for libraries impacting project releases
  if it is deemed critical to the release and the risk of an update
  causing regressions is low.

  To request an exception for a library release past the freeze, send
  an email to the openstack-dev mailing list with the following tags
  in the subject line::

    [release][requirements][other-impacted-projects]

  The release and requirements teams will evaluate the risks and provide
  feedback.

  If at all possible, it is best to wait until the freeze is over and do
  a stable release of the library afterwards.

Milestone 3 / Feature Freeze
----------------------------

- Feature development stops ("feature freeze")
- Message strings stop changing ("string freeze") to give the
  translation team time to finish their work
- Dependency specifications stop changing ("requirements freeze") to
  give packagers time to prepare packages
- Final releases for client libraries for all projects. Note that new
  features that block other projects need to be released earlier in
  the cycle than this, since the projects will not be able to adopt
  them while the feature freeze and requirements freeze are in effect.

Feature Freeze +1
-----------------

- Final Feature Freeze Exceptions merged
- Create stable branches for all libraries

Release Candidate Period, Release -3
------------------------------------

The release candidate period spans several weeks, and usually starts
the week after the feature freeze.

- All projects issue their first release candidates
- Create branches for all services to use for release candidates, and
  eventually stable maintenance work
- Submit cycle-highlights in the project deliverables yaml file. See
  below for information about cycle-highlights.

  During this period, patches submitted to and being merged into the
  new branch should be managed carefully.

  1. Avoid aggressive backports during this time period, since having
     a lot of pending reviews consumes reviewer resources and makes it
     harder to understand which patches are release blockers.
  2. All code patches should merge into the master branch before being
     approved to merge into the new release branch.
  3. Translation updates should be merged quickly to ensure they make
     it into the final release.
  4. Requirements sync patches should be merged quickly to ensure they
     make it into the final release.

Release -2
----------

- Create the stable branch for the global requirements list and
  testing tools like devstack and grenade
- Remove the freeze for the global requirements list on the master
  branch
- Freeze all library releases, except independently-released libraries
  (which can still be released, although constraint and requirement changes
  will be held until the end the freeze period)

Release -1
----------

Final release candidates, with translations

Release 0
---------

- Emergency last-minute release candidates (unlikely)
- Tag the final release candidates as the official release early on
  Thursday of this week
- All library releases freeze on master ends

Managing Release Notes
======================

Release notes for OpenStack deliverables are managed in the source
repository for the project using reno_. The reno documentation
explains how the tool works in general, and the instructions below
explain how to set it up for use in your project.

Directory Structure
-------------------

Most projects have a ``doc/source`` directory with Sphinx configured
to build developer-focused documentation that is eventually published
under ``https://docs.openstack.org/developer/$PROJECT``. Release notes
are not developer-focused, so they need to be published separately,
and that means a separate Sphinx project in the source tree. The jobs
that run the release note builds expect to find that project in
``releasenotes/source``.

The release note files read by reno should be kept in
``releasenotes/notes``. *Only* release notes YAML files should be
placed in this directory.

Setting up the Release Note Tool Within Your Project
----------------------------------------------------

The release notes are built from the configuration in the master
branch, and pull notes from all of the stable branches for which notes
should be published. Start by following these steps to configure the
master branch build, and then backporting necessary changes to the
stable branches where you wish to use reno.

#. Set up a new Sphinx project using ``sphinx-quickstart``. The
   interactive prompts will ask where to put the new files. If you run
   the tool from the root of your git repository, answering
   ``releasenotes/source`` will produce the correct results.

#. Edit ``releasenotes/source/conf.py`` to change the ``extensions``
   list to include ``'reno.sphinxext'``.

#. Edit ``releasenotes/source/conf.py`` and add:

   ::

      # -- Options for Internationalization output ------------------------------
      locale_dirs = ['locale/']

#. Edit ``test-requirements.txt`` to add ``reno``. Make sure to use
   the current entry from the global requirements list to avoid
   version conflicts.

#. Create a directory ``releasenotes/notes`` and add an empty
   ``.placeholder`` file to ensure git tracks the directory.

#. Create a file to hold the release notes from the "current" branch
   by using a ``release-notes`` directive without specifying an
   explicit branch. This file is used by the test jobs to ensure that
   patches on a stable branch cannot introduce release notes that
   break the real release notes build job on the master branch. For
   example, Glance uses ``releasenotes/source/unreleased.rst``
   containing:

   ::

      ==============================
       Current Series Release Notes
      ==============================

      .. release-notes::

#. Create a separate file for each stable branch for which you plan to
   use reno to manage release notes. Use the ``release-notes``
   directive to generate the correct release notes for each
   series. For example, the liberty release is represented in a file
   called ``releasenotes/source/liberty.rst`` containing:

   ::

      ==============================
       Liberty Series Release Notes
      ==============================

      .. release-notes::
         :branch: stable/liberty

#. Edit ``releasenotes/source/index.rst`` to remove most of the
   automatically-generated content and replace it with a title and
   ``toctree`` referring to the branch files you created in the
   previous two steps.

#. Update ``tox.ini`` to add a ``releasenotes`` test environment by
   adding:

   ::

      [testenv:releasenotes]
      commands = sphinx-build -a -W -E -d releasenotes/build/doctrees -b html releasenotes/source releasenotes/build/html

#. Submit all of the above changes together as one patch. For example,
   see https://review.openstack.org/241323 and
   https://review.openstack.org/243302 (Glance was set up using 2
   separate patches).

.. note::

   Repeat this process for any existing stable branches for which reno
   is being used for release notes, back through
   stable/liberty. Although we do not run reno in the branches to
   publish the notes, we *do* run it in test jobs to ensure that
   release note changes in stable branches do not break the release
   note build in master.

Adding the Release Notes Jobs to Your CI
----------------------------------------

After your project has the necessary change to enable reno to build
the release notes, the next step is to modify the CI system to add the
necessary jobs. All of these changes are made to the
``openstack-infra/project-config`` repository.

#. Modify the section of ``jenkins/jobs/projects.yaml`` related to
   your repository to add the ``openstack-releasenotes-jobs`` job
   group to the list of jobs for your project.

#. Modify the section of ``zuul/layout.yaml`` related to your
   repository to add ``release-notes-jobs`` to the list of job
   templates for your project.

#. Submit all of the changes as one patch. You may want to set the
   ``Depends-On`` tag in the commit message to point to the Change-Id
   of the commit from the previous section, to avoid adding jobs that
   will fail until that patch lands. For example, see
   https://review.openstack.org/241344.

How to Add New Release Notes
----------------------------

reno scans the git history to find release notes files and tags to
determine which notes are part of each release. That means you need to
put the notes for a release into the branch where the release will be
generated *before* the release is tagged. The note files can be edited
later, but they will always appear under the first release in the
series where they were introduced.

In general, release notes should be added with fixes that go into the
master branch, and then included in the backport for the fix as it
goes into older stable branches. Because the release notes for each
series are generated separately, the same note may appear in the
output for multiple versions.

If a note does not apply to the master branch for some reason, it can
be added directly to the stable branch.

Use ``reno new`` to generate a new release note file with a unique
suffix value. The unique filename created by reno ensures that there
will be no merge conflicts as the fix is backported. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tox -e venv -- reno new bug-XXX

After the new file is created, edit it to remove any sections that are
not relevant and to add notes under the appropriate sections. Refer to
the `Editing a Release Note
<https://docs.openstack.org/developer/reno/user/usage.html#creating-new-release-notes>`__
section of the reno documentation for details about what should go in
each section of the YAML file and for tips on formatting notes.

To see the rendered version of the new release note, you need to
commit the change so reno can find the note file in the git log, and
then build the release notes documentation.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git commit  # Commit the change because reno scans git log.

  $ tox -e releasenotes

Then look at the generated release notes files in
``releasenotes/build/html`` in a web browser.

When to Add Release Notes
-------------------------

The release notes for a patch should be included in the patch. If not, the
release notes should be in a follow-on review.

If the patch meets any of the following criteria, a release note is
recommended.

* Upgrades

  * The deployer needs to take an action when upgrading
  * A new configuration option is added that the deployer should
    consider changing from the default
  * A configuration option is deprecated
  * A configuration option is removed

* Features

  * A new feature is implemented
  * A feature is marked for deprecation
  * A feature is removed
  * Default behavior is changed

* Bugs

  * A security bug is fixed
  * A long-standing or important bug is fixed

* APIs

  * A driver interface or other plugin API changes
  * A REST API changes

Not every patch is worth a release note. A user may skim through the
release notes for a dozen projects or more after the release, what is
helpful and what may be noise should be considered carefully.

.. _reno: https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/

How to Write a Good Release Note
--------------------------------

Release notes should be written from the perspective of the user and
what they should know. Here are a few sample questions to keep in mind
when writing them:

* What is particularly relevant from the end-user/deployer's
  perspective?
* What changes for them?
* Is there anything they need to do in particular?
* Will the change have an impact on their day-to-day use?

Release notes are not meant to be a replacement for git commit
messages. They should focus on the impact for the user and make that
understandable, even for people who don't know the full technical
context for the patch or project.

Updating Stable Branch Release Notes
------------------------------------

Occasionally it is necessary to update release notes for past releases.
Release notes need to be handled differently than normal code backports.

.. note::

   Due to the way reno parses release notes, if a note is updated on
   master instead of its original stable branch, it will then show up
   in the release notes for the later release.

See the reno user documentation for details on the correct way to
`Update stable branch release notes
<https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/user/usage.html#updating-stable-branch-release-notes>`__.

How to Preview Release Notes at RC-time
---------------------------------------

OpenStack projects on the common cycle with development milestones will
typically add a release note before each milestone and release candidate
is tagged.  These will appear on the same generated page, but separated
by tag.  After the stable branch is tagged for final release, however,
when the release notes are generated they will all be combined into a
single note.  If you're following the advice above about what to include
in release notes (and including release notes throughout the development
cycle on appropriate patches), then you're likely to have some notes with
a Prelude, some without, and so on for all the sections.  Before the release
is cut, you'll probably want to see exactly what the single generated note
is going to look like so that you can read through the entire note in the
same order that consumers will read it.  Here's one way to do that:

* Clone a new repo from git or make sure your copy is completely up to
  date.

* Suppose you're preparing for the Pike release, which will be tagged
  as '15.0.0' and is being prepared in the branch 'stable/pike'.
  Check out the stable/pike branch and create a tag for the release
  in your local repository: ``git tag 15.0.0``

* Check out master, and generate the release notes the usual way:
  ``tox -e releasenotes``

* Browse to the generated notes in the releasenotes/build/html
  directory

* When you're done proof reading, delete the tag:
  ``git tag -d 15.0.0``

Cycle Highlights
================

Cycle highlights give a high-level, user-focused summary of what has
changed in the latest release. This is not necessarily the most
technically complex work you accomplished in the release, but is the
work that will have the largest impact on users. Cycle highlights
auto-populate the Release Highlights page at
``releases.openstack.org/$RELEASE/highlights.html``.

Adding Cycle Highlights
-----------------------

Cycle highlights should be submitted with RC1. This is done by adding
information to ``deliverables/$RELEASE/$PROJECT.yaml`` in the
``openstack/releases`` repo. You should include 3-5 cycle-highlight bullets.

.. code-block:: yaml

  cycle-highlights:
    - Introduced new service to use unused host to mine bitcoin
    - Merged code from shade, os-client-config and openstacksdk into
      a single library to create a unified and simpler our client-side library
    - Added Rescue Mode to let users recover from lost SSH keys and
      misconfigurations


You can check on the formatting of the output by either running locally:

.. code-block:: console

  tox -e docs

And checking the resulting file under ``doc/build/html/$RELEASE/highlights.html``,
or you can view the output of the ``build-openstack-sphinx-docs`` job under
``html/$RELEASE/highlights.html``.

Writing a Good Cycle Highlight
------------------------------

Unlike commit messages for developers or reno release notes for operators,
cycle highlights are intended to give product managers, press, marketers,
users not responsible for operations, etc a snapshot of what will change
for them in this release. You submit 3-5 cycle-highlights bullets, with
a format of:

- What was changed/introduced, what it does for the user/benefit

Highlights should stay fairly brief--aim for less than 2 lines in length.

By submitting your highlights at RC1 or as close as possible, the
Release Management Team will be able to offer edits and help you write
cycle highlights that show off your work.
