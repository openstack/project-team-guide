 Documentation
===============

The OpenStack documentation team supports developers and authors in
writing documentation for a number of audiences. As is the case with
most horizontal teams, the documentation team is not there to write
documentation on behalf of projects, but will assist them and help
coordinate standards across all of the projects.

OpenStack documentation serves a number of audiences: contributors to
OpenStack, developers building applications on top of OpenStack, and
operators of OpenStack clouds. Each project has a role in providing
documentation to all of those audiences, though the nature of that
role varies.

All of the project documentation (for all audiences) is published to
and indexed at http://docs.openstack.org and is automatically updated
on each commit.

Documentation for Contributors
==============================

OpenStack projects maintain their own documentation for their
contributors. This includes code comments as well as narrative and
reference documentation. Contributor documentation is maintained
within the project's own git repository and is written in
reStructuredText.

Documentation for Developers
============================

OpenStack APIs are documented for the use of developers writing
applications that interact with OpenStack components. These docs are
typically written in RST using the `os-api-ref
<https://docs.openstack.org/os-api-ref/>`_ tool and published to
`docs.openstack.org <https://docs.openstack.org>`_. The API working
group has published `guidelines for OpenStack APIs
<https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/#guidelines>`_.

Documentation for Operators and Users
=====================================

OpenStack projects maintain their own documentation for operators and
end users. This includes information on running and operating the software,
concept guides, reference documentation, and more. There are also full-length
manuals for OpenStack operators and users available, managed in their own
repositories. Often these manuals are authored by operators and users
themselves, with help from project teams.

How to Contribute Documentation
===============================

The documentation team maintains a
`guide with instructions on how to contribute documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/doc-contrib-guide/>`_.
