==================
Spreading the Word
==================

As a TC initiative during the Xena cycle, we took on the task of putting
together a list of possible places you as PTLs could help spread the word
about what you and your team mates do. Getting the word out about your project
is a great way to get additional contributors and users, for both your project
and OpenStack as a whole. Not everyone enjoys talking to groups or writing,
so we've put together a list of potential opportunities so you can choose what
makes you comfortable.

Live Streams
============

Live Streams tend to be more low key and conversational so a great way to
present information without standing up in a room at a conference to present.

#. OpenInfra Live - https://openinfrafoundation.formstack.com/forms/openinfralive

   * OpenInfra Live is “A conversation around all things open infrastructure”
     hosted by the Open Infrastructure Foundation. It consists of:
   * 1 hour sessions every week, 2021 only
   * Product focused (reasonably technical and can cover Red Hat OpenStack
     Platform as a product) think of people at a trade show session

#. Cloud Tech Tuesdays - reach out to amy@demarco.com or amy@redhat.com

   * Cloud Tech Tuesdays is intended to cover all aspects of the stack from
     infrastructure to application and is hosted on the OpenShift.tv Twitch
     stream.
   * 1 hour sessions every 2 weeks
   * Upstream focused, less product oriented, can be highly technical, not as
     polished
   * Shows start with a presentation/demo and ask questions during it so it
     becomes more of a conversation and end with more questions if there are
     any.
